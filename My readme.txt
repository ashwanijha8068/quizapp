//Brief description
I have started with aim to obtain similar UI as provided . Created the Context.js which has been used by various other components. It contains all the aspects of the quiz suzh as index,correct, loading,questions, checkAnswers etc by fetching the data from api.I have used modal for quiz body container .
challenges faced:
1)to make every components responsive.
2)Due to modal , i was not able to place the trophy image on top of Congratulations!
3)creating the Setup Quiz page as it was not in the document but on seeing the api website i thought it would be a good addition

steps to run the project
cd quizapp
npm start
